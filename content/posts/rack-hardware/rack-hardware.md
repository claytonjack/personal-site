### Introduction

When I began my journey into the world home servers and selfhosting I never imagined that it would spiral into what it has become now. What originally started as a simple Synology NAS has evolved into a complex infrastructure of custom built hardware, hosting everything from storage arrays, virtual machines, and containers. This project started as a fun side project but at this stage it has become the backbone of my home network, providing me with the services I need to live an enjoyable and productive life.

### My First NAS

At a young age, I always loved collecting things and this continued when I became interested in technology. Everyone has that voice in the back of their head telling them that some day they will need to access that old podcast episode while offline. At a certain point, you end up with thousands of files and need a way to manage them. At this point, I turned to prebuilt NAS solutions and eventually settled on the Synology DiskStation DS415+. This NAS was a great entry point and introduced me to new technologies like SMB.

### Synology Failure

This setup however would not last long. In 2017, not long after my warranty expired, I experienced a sudden failure in my unit that rendered it unusable. After some research, I discovered that this was a widespread issue with various router and NAS devices and was caused by a [design flaw in Intel Atom C2000 series chips](https://www.anandtech.com/show/11110/semi-critical-intel-atom-c2000-flaw-discovered). Synology refused to offer any support so I went about trying to repair it myself. Other users had reported success by replacing the faulty chip with a new one so I decided to give it a try. After a few hours of soldering, I had successfully replaced the chip and my NAS was back up and running. This was a great learning experience and taught me a lot about hardware repair.
